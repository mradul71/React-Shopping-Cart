# React-Shopping-Cart
Here I have implemented Shopping cart without Redux.

Here the data is initially saved in data.js file and the operations are performed on the data in this file.

It has certain operations like Adding and Removing from the cart and a proceed form.

All, it has filter options like filter on the basis of sizes and price.
